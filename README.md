# Layered Testbench
## A simple layered testbench built to test OpenCore's I2C Multiple Bus Controller with its Wishbone Interface
A layered testbench based on simplified UVM principles for the OpenCores I2C Multiple Bus Controller with its Wishbone Interface. Constrained random and directed tests are used in verification. This testbench verifies certain features of the specification such as multi-bus functionality, clock stretching, multi-master arbitration, multi-master clock synchronization. Partial testing is also conducted on internal registers and state machines.
